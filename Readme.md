# Intro
For it being a superset of Javascript it allows great blend of OOP.
In here I showcase Inheritance , Composition and Polymorphism.

## Inheritance
As it is to all OOP langs it is having classes that are like children getting props and met of parents. In inh.ys file I have a class Animal that is the parent and class Dog that is the child. Dog inherits name(prop) and move(met). It then has more met(bark). When instantiated all the mets are there.

## Composition
This involves class coming up together to create a bigger class. In comp.ts an interface Engine and a class CarEngine are created to join together and become car class.

## Polymorphism
Poly:- Many Morph:- Forms . In poly.ts interface shape is being used to create the forms that are in Rectangle and Circle.
